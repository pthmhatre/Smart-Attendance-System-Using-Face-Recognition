In any organization, whether it be educational, industrial or corporate, attendance is an important aspect to evaluate the overall productivity of that organization. A proper attendance record will help to easily acquire any data related to particular individual or member and to maintain the services record. Attendance evaluation allows a greater degree of control over the individuals productivity and maintaining a proper validation of students/employees. The aim of Smart Attendance system is to design an efficient way to record and maintain student attendance data that will overcome the drawbacks of the traditional or manual attendance system. Attendance Management System is software developed for daily student attendance in schools, colleges and institutes. It facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. A smart attendance system enables setting up the attendance workflows and maintaining a proper validation of students.
